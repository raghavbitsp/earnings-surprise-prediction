# Earnings Surprise Prediction in the Indian Retail Sector

## Project Summary

Built an end-to-end earnings surprise forecasting framework using multi-year panel data across 25+ Indian consumer-facing companies.

The framework integrates:

- Analyst consensus estimates  
- Company fundamentals  
- Price and volume dynamics  
- Sector-level indicators  
- Market regime signals  

The objective was to study whether pre-announcement information can systematically anticipate earnings beats and misses.

## Key Results

### 1. Predictive Performance

- Achieved ~83–86% classification accuracy  
- ROC-AUC of ~0.76–0.79  
- Performance consistent across:
  - Stable market conditions  
  - Elevated volatility regimes  

Models successfully captured directional EPS surprise with strong out-of-sample validation under rolling time splits.

### 2. Trading Strategy Backtest

Designed:

- Pre-earnings positioning strategy  
- Post-earnings continuation strategy  

Using model-generated signals:

- Generated ~7–9% cumulative alpha over two quarters  
- Maximum drawdown below 3%  
- Risk-adjusted performance aligned with documented post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD)

Backtesting assumptions:

- Strict chronological validation  
- No lookahead bias  
- Realistic execution timing

## Modeling Framework

Models evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)  

Validation approach:

- Rolling walk-forward splits  
- Regime robustness testing  
- Out-of-sample evaluation

## Research Implications

Findings suggest:

1. Earnings surprises exhibit partial predictability in sector-focused settings.  
2. Positioning and demand proxies add incremental signal beyond fundamentals.  
3. PEAD-style continuation effects remain economically exploitable under disciplined risk control.
